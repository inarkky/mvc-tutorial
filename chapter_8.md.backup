# Chapter 8 - Recap

We will use this chapter as a breather - to look back on what we have done and to talk about things we will do next.  
If you have followed a tutorial until now, you folder structure probably looks somewhat like this:

```
root/
	index.php
	application/
		config/
			config.php
			routes.php
		controllers/
			MainController.php
		core/
			Controller.php
			Middleware.php
			Model.php
			Router.php
			View.php
		helpers/
			Cookies.php
			CSRF.php
			DB.php
			Request.php
			SecureSession.php
			Validation.php
		middleware/
			Persister.php
		models/
			Main.php
		storage/
			sessions/
	public/
		components/
		errors/
			400.php
			404.php
			500.php
		layouts/
			default.php
		views/
			main/
				index.php
```

We started somewhat slow, with just the bare bones of the framework, but over the course of the tutorial we were addeing to that and little by little, our framework became more and more.. well, usable. We added db support, tighten our seurity, abstract the system for session and cookies and we even have a validation system.

So the next part of the tutorial will focus on file handling, and localization, and when when we are done with that we are going to build our own templating engine for fasterfrontend developing
